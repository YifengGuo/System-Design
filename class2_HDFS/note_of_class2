datanode: for data storage
          actually is a java running process

	  do not recommend multiple datanodes running on one machine 
          for this will slow down disk IO speed

namenode: most essential
          to avoid namenode crash
               two namenode: 1. active namenode
                             2. stand-by namenode
          there is always only one namenode working
          if active namenode crashed, stand-by namenode will
          take over the job.

Challenge of this architecture:
1. sync of two namenode. data consistency
    failure detection. 
    guarantee data in both namenode is synchronized
    recovery mechanism
