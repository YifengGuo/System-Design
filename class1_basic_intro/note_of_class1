Cloud: more focus on different customized service


Distributed File System 
1. use file system interfaces to manage your data(files and directories)
2. Data is distributed in many machines
3. Examples: GFS(Google FileSystem), HDFS(Hadoop Distributed FileSystem), Ceph FS, GlusterFS, MapR FS
4. When to use a DFS?
    1). data is large scale
    2). for many users
    3). analyzed by data's model or property to decide whether use database or DFS


In memory FileSystem advantage
    good to be used as cache (fast and reliable)


HDFS Key features and assumptions
    1. Scale up to 100+ PB of storage and a single cluster of several thousand servers
       supporting close to a billion files and blocks
    2. Designed to run on commodity hardware
        


Composition vs Inheritance
we need to avoid to many levels of inheritance and shall consider using composition
